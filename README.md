## Introduction
---
***This project is about using Excel to create a predictive model to identify transactions with a high risk score. Also to describe the steps one would take, including data preparation, model creation, and validation. Another thing discussed is the functions or add-ins  one could use***

### Problem Statement
1. What Model is best fit to carry-out this prediction?
2. 

 The First step is deciding what machine learning model in excel to apply. I decided to use use _**Multiple Linear Regression**_ as the intention is analyze relationships between other independent variables (Other columns) with one dependent variable( i.e.. the Risk Score) as this will help me Predict transactions with high-risk scores.[Read More on Why Linear Regression here](https://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/when-use-regression-analysis/)
