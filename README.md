## Introduction
---
***This project is about using Excel to create a predictive model to identify transactions with a high risk score. Also to describe the steps one would take, including data preparation, model creation, and validation. Another thing discussed is the functions or add-ins  one could use***



## Problem Statement
1. What Model is best fit to carry-out this prediction and Why?
2. Describe the steps taken including data preparation and model creation.
3. What is the validation of the model?


**1. What Model is best fit to carry-out this prediction and Why?**
   
 The First step is deciding what machine learning model in excel to apply. I decided to use use  because  it is used to describe the relationships between a set of independent variables and the dependent variable. Since the intention is to analyze relationships between other independent variables (Other columns) with one dependent variable( i.e.. the Risk Score), _**Multiple Linear Regression**_ is what i will be using to Predict transactions with _high-risk scores_.

**2. Describe the steps taken including data preparation and model creation.**
